    <p>Web development refers to the creating, building, and maintaining of websites. It includes aspects such as web
        design, web publishing, web programming, and database management. It is the creation of an application that
        works over the internet i.e. websites. Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it's the
        work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless
        user experience</p>
    <!--case sensitive-->
    <P>Why is web development important?
        <br>
        Web development is important for differentiating your business from competitors because it can help you stand
        out from the crowd. If you have a website that is well-designed, easy to navigate, and visually appealing, you
        will be more likely to attract customers than similar businesses that don't have these features.!

            If both Frontend and Backend development appeal to you, you could consider becoming a Full-Stack Developer.

            Full-stackers take care of both the front-end and the back-end, and need to know how the web works on all
            levels, in order to determine how the client- and server-sides will relate. Naturally working up to this
            level of expertise will take longer, as there is more to learn.</p>
        <p>The backend developer engineers what is going on behind the scenes. This is where the data is stored, and
            without this data, there would be no frontend. The backend of the web consists of the server that hosts the
            website, an application for running it and a database to contain the data.

            The backend dev uses computer programmes to ensure that the server, the application and the database run
            smoothly together. This type of dev need to analyse what a company’s needs are and provide efficient
            programming solutions. To do all this amazing stuff they use a variety of server-side languages, like PHP,
            Ruby, Python and Java..</p>
        <p>All this may sound daunting at first, but you don’t need to know everything at once. You will grow your
            knowledge progressively. And things will begin to click.

            The great news is, learning to become a developer is easily accessible and affordable. This is especially
            true with OpenClassrooms. Emily Reese, Web developer and Teacher at OpenClassrooms explains,</p>

    <h5>header</h5>
    <header class="head">*When designing a user interface, an important part of creating a consistent experience is to
        design a consistent look and feel for the page. To create a look and feel, the first task is to develop and
        implement consistent page layout. Here that involves creating a header and footer section for the page.

        To start the format for the header should be defined. A typical header presents information such as a title
        associated with the program or entity, other heading elements (such as the organization), a logo, and author
        information. Also, in the header is a menu of options for the system, which for now will contain the entries
        Home, File, and About. The header we will create for this page is as follows.

    </header>
    <h5>footer</h5>
    <footer>
        <p>They provide site visitors with one more opportunity to complete the desired action. If you want people to
            sign up for your mailing list, view a product demo, or contact you, inviting them at the end of a scroll is
            an effective call to action, similar to CTAs at the end of advertisements.
            They show how to stay involved in the future. By including navigation links in the footer, you allow site
            visitors to continue exploring without having to scroll back up.
            They provide necessary access to important information but should not be given top billing (i.e. your
            copyright info, privacy statements and legal disclaimers).</p>
    </footer>
    <h1>Span element</h1>
    <span id="fari">
        <p style="background-color: rgb(236, 188, 13);color: rgb(237, 34, 34);">The span tag is a widely-used inline
            element in HTML that is used for styling or grouping inline elements without creating a new line. It's
            typically used when you need to apply styles or target a section of text or inline elements with JavaScript</p>
